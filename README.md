# Setting up Backend - Read Readme in Backend

## Challenges Faced

### Learning Node.js and Express
- Since I had no experience with Node.js , learning **Node.js** and **Express** was a significant challenge.
### Set up routes, handle requests, and connect to APIs
### Parsing responses and Error handling 
### Learning NextJs 


## How I overcame these challenges :
- My earlier exposure to similar concepts in Reactjs/Axios/APIs
- Online research 
- Constant failing and learning
- Breaking down concepts into smaller tasks!
